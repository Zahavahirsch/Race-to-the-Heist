In the shadows of the night, a world-renowned burglar known only as NAME 
was on the hunt for THEIR biggest challenge yet: 
to outsmart THEIR arch-rival, The Nightingale, 
a master thief who had been one step ahead of THEM for years. 
NAME had spent months gathering intelligence on Nightingale, 
tracking Nightingale's movements and patterns, 
but all of THEIR efforts had led to dead ends.

Whispers had reached THEM that The Nightingale was planning something big.
NAME knew that THEY had to act fast if THEY wanted to beat THEIR rival to the prize. 
And so THEY set THEIR sights on the one place THEY knew THEIR rival would go to plan the next heist:
Nightingale's secret office.

NAME broke into the office, 
using THEIR expert skills to slip past security undetected. 
NAME searched through the space, THEIR heart racing with excitement,
and found a number of cryptic messages and markings. 
With a sudden burst of inspiration, 
NAME realized that the messages and markings created clues;
clues that would lead THEM straight to THEIR goal! 


Time is of the essence. 
Figure out where The Nightingale is planning the next heist!
